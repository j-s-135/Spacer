# spacer
Java data tree converter. 
It can be downloaded at downloads.treeconverter.com.
Spacer is the early version of my website, treeconverter.com.
Spacer is free for all to use, but we request that you don't change the code. 
If you would like to improve the code, please submit an edit to this repository. 
Spacer is just a plain text program, but we would like to update it to include rich text and insert images.
It also should have a file converter to load .docx and .pdf files, among others.
We invite you to contribute code that would realize these changes.
If you require payment, please formally apply at treeconverter.com, or send us an email.
