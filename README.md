# spacer
Java plain text data tree converter. 
It can be downloaded at downloads.treeconverter.com.
Spacer is the early version of my website, treeconverter.com.
Spacer is free for all to use, but we request that you don't change the code. 
If you would like to improve the code, fork it and submit a pull request. 
It requires a text file converter to load .docx and .pdf files, among other things.
We invite you to contribute code that would realize these changes.
If you require payment, send us an email request.
