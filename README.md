# spacer
Java plain text data tree converter. 
It can be downloaded at downloads.treeconverter.com.
Spacer is free for all to use, but it is licensed, so we request that you cite us as your source, and don't change the code. 
If you would like to improve the code, fork it and submit a pull request. 
It requires a text file converter to load .docx and .pdf files, and professional styling, among other things.
We invite you to contribute code that would realize these changes, or other useful functions.
If you require payment, send us an email request.
